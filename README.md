# Java and Spring (Boot) 


### Spring Security
In this lab, implemented basic spring boot security functionalities to provide authentication and authorization in app.
Used multiple Authentication Providers such as In-memory database authentication, jdbcAUthentication and DAOAuthentication through JAP using Mysql database.
Also learnt how Authentication works under the hood by through AuthenticationManager, ProviderManager, AuthenticationProvider, UserDetailsService etc.
 
 
### Java Concurrency
Touched on the basics of concurrency in Java such as, Locks, Synchronization, Condition classes and "wait and noify", Thread Pool frameworks like ExecutorService and ForkJoin Pool,
Callables and Future. Semaphores, Interrupts and Deadlocks. Will be adding more as I learn new stuff. 


### Producer and Consumer
It's a popular concurrency design pattern, where you have multiple thread consumers and multiple thread produceres pushing a data into some data structure like Queue, How do you make this data passing via a datastructure thread safe.


### Scatter and Gather
It's another popular concurrency design pattern, where you need to get response from three different resources via some network call or database call. How do you make an efficient request and gather the response.
